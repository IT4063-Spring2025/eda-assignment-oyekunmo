# # Exploratory Data Analysis - Assignment
# 
# ## üîç Overview
# This lab is designed to help you practice exploratory data analysis using Python. You will work with some housing data for the state of California. You will use various data visualization and analysis techniques to gain insights and identify patterns in the data, and clean and preprocess the data to make it more suitable for analysis. The lab is divided into the following sections:
# 
# - Data Loading and Preparation
# - Data Visualization
# - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (using visualizations)
# 
# ## üéØ Objectives
# This assignment assess your ability to:
# - Load and pre-process data using `pandas`
# - Clean data and preparing it for analysis
# - Use visualization techniques to explore and understand the data
# - Use visualization techniques to identify patterns and relationships in the data
# - Use visualization to derive insights from the data
# - Apply basic statistical analysis to derive insights from the data
# - Communicate your findings through clear and effective data visualizations and summaries

# What could the lines of values at the top of the chart mean here?
üíª:I noticed that there is a correlation between the housing median age and total rooms, as age increases, a trend shows that the number of total rooms goes lower.

# ### Task 7: Data Cleaning - Duplicate Data

# #### 7.1: Find duplicate data

# In[88]:


# üíª Identify the duplicate data in the dataset
housing.duplicated()
housing.duplicated().sum()


# ### Task 8: Data Cleaning - Missing Data

# #### 8.1: Find missing data

# In[89]:


# üíª Identify the missing data in the dataset
housing.isnull().sum()


# #### 8.2: show a sample of 5 records of the rows with missing data
# Notice there are 2 keywords here: `sample` and (rows with missing data)
# 
# <details>
#   <summary>ü¶â Hints:</summary>
# 
#   * You'll do pandas filtering here
#   * You'll need to use the `isna()` or `isnull()` method on the 1 feature with missing data. to find the rows with missing data
#   * you'll need to use the `sample()` method to get a sample of 5 records of the results
# </details>

# In[99]:


# üíª use Pandas Filtering to show all the records with missing `total_bedrooms` field
null_rows = housing[housing['total_bedrooms'].isnull()]
null_rows.sample(5)


# #### 8.3: Calculate the central tendency values of the missing data feature
# * Calculate the mean, median, trimmed mean

# In[101]:


# üíª get the mean, median and trimmed mean of the total_bedrooms column
total_bedrooms_median = housing['total_bedrooms'].median()
total_berooms_mean = housing['total_bedrooms'].mean()
total_bedrooms_trimmed_mean = trim_mean(housing['total_bedrooms'], 0.1)

print(f"Median: {total_bedrooms_median}")
print(f"Mean: {total_berooms_mean}")
print(f"Trimmed Mean: {total_bedrooms_trimmed_mean}")


# #### 8.4: Visualize the distribution of the missing data feature
# * Plot a histogram of the missing data feature (total_bedrooms)

# In[105]:


# üíª Plot the histogram of the total_bedrooms column

housing['total_bedrooms'].hist(figsize=(10,10))


# #### 8.5: Choose one of the central tendency values and use it to fill in the missing data
# * Justify your choice
# * Don't use the `inplace` parameter, instead, create a new dataframe with the updated values. (this is a bit challenging)
# * show the first 5 records of the new dataframe to confirm we got the full dataframe
# 
# [üìú You should find a good example here](https://www.sharpsightlabs.com/blog/pandas-fillna/#example-2)

# In[ ]:


# üíª Fill the missing values in the total_bedrooms column with an appropriate value, then show the first 5 records of the new dataframe
housing_copy = housing.copy()
housing_copy = housing_copy.fillna(value={'total_bedrooms':total_bedrooms_median})
housing_copy.head(5)


# ‚ùì Why did you choose this value?
üíª I chose the median because the histogram we made for the total_bedrooms gave us a very skewed distribution. This means that we ended up with heavy outliers, and the median would be less affected by outliers compared to the other central tendency values. Because it's simply the middle value of the skewed graph, adding data values equal to the mean would preserve the state of the original distribution the best.
# #### 8.6: Confirm that there are no more missing values in the new dataframe
# * make sure the dataframe contains all features, not just the `total_bedrooms` feature

# In[115]:


# üíª Confirm the new dataframe has no missing values
housing_copy = housing_copy.fillna(0)
housing_copy.isnull().sum()


# #### 8.7: Dropping the missing data
# assume we didn't want to impute the missing data, and instead, we wanted to drop the rows with missing data.
# * don't use the `inplace` parameter, instead, create a new dataframe with the updated values.

# In[116]:


# üíª drop the missing rows of the total_bedroom and save it to a new dataframe
housing_copy2 = housing.dropna()


# #### 8.8: Confirm that there are no more missing values in the new dataframe
# * make sure the dataframe contains all features, not just the `total_bedrooms` feature

# In[117]:


# üíª Confirm the new dataframe has no missing values
housing_copy2.isnull().sum()
